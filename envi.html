      <div id="list-1">
        <ul style="font-size: 24px; ">
            <li>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns on Earth, driven largely by human activities since the Industrial Revolution, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These activities emit greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to an increase in the planet's average surface temperature by about 1.5°C (2.5°F) since the 19th century.</li>
            <li>This warming results in significant environmental impacts, including melting glaciers and sea ice, thawing permafrost, rising sea levels, and expanding deserts. The Arctic is warming the fastest, causing changes in ecosystems and forcing species to relocate or face extinction. Oceans absorb much of the excess heat, contributing to ocean warming and acidification, which threaten marine life and coral reefs.</li>
            <li>Climate change also intensifies extreme weather events, resulting in more frequent and severe storms, heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires. These changes affect agriculture, water supplies, infrastructure, and human health, posing substantial risks globally.</li>
            <li>Even if greenhouse gas emissions are drastically reduced, some effects like sea level rise and ocean acidification will continue for centuries because of the long-lasting nature of these gases and the delayed response of oceans.</li>
            <li>Scientific consensus confirms that recent climate change is unprecedented in speed and magnitude relative to natural variations over millennia. Sophisticated satellite data and climate models have verified the link between human-induced greenhouse gas emissions and global warming.</li>
            <li>Efforts to tackle climate change involve transitioning to renewable energy, protecting forests, and developing sustainable practices. However, the political influence of fossil fuel industries often poses challenges to effective climate action. The global community recognizes climate change as the greatest threat to sustainable development and emphasizes urgent, collective solutions to avoid irreversible damage to the planet.</li>
            <li>In summary, climate change is a profound global challenge that threatens ecosystems, human societies, and the Earth's future livability, requiring immediate and sustained efforts worldwide to mitigate its impacts.</li>
            <li>Global Temperature Rise: Earth's average surface temperature has increased about 1.5°C since the Industrial Revolution, with most warming occurring in the past 40 years. This trend is primarily driven by increased atmospheric CO₂ concentrations, now more than 50% higher than pre-industrial levels.</li>
            <li>Record Heat: Years 2023 and 2024 have been the hottest on record globally, with 2024 reaching 1.28°C above 20th-century averages, causing extreme heatwaves and weather patterns.</li>
            <li>Ecosystem Impacts: Climate change leads to severe effects such as desert expansion, melting of polar ice sheets, more intense storms, wildfires, droughts, and threats to biodiversity with many species forced to migrate or face extinction.</li>
            <li>Sea Level Rise: Melting glaciers and thermal expansion of seawater are causing sea levels to rise, threatening coastal communities and increasing flooding risks worldwide. Long-term projections estimate several meters of sea level rise over millennia.</li>
            <li>Tipping Points: Certain thresholds—such as the potential collapse of Greenland’s ice sheet or Atlantic Ocean circulation—could cause irreversible changes in climate systems with catastrophic impacts.</li>
